# SQL-Projects
Hey Everyone -- My name is Johann Somosa... I created this portfolio to showcase the projects I enjoyed working on. I am interested in studying the relationships between different variables across multiple industries. I come from a family of self-starters comprised of freelancers or small-business owners. While often they have an entreprenurial spirit, there are large amounts of data that aren't taken into account. Data that would provide useful insight on future decisions, strategies, and adjustments. It provides knowledge that would help their decision-making in order to impact their business goals. I hope to use data analytics as just one tool. In this portfolio, I will focus on SQL to create datasets, store data, and organize data for future purposes. I will showcase series of real world requests and its translation into SQL commands. If any project provide useful insight, or there are topics you'd be interested in joining research in, please feel free to reach out to me!
